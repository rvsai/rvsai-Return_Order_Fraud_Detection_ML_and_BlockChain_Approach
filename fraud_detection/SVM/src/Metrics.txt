Precision:
Definition: Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives (i.e., how many selected instances are relevant).
Formula:
Precision
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Positives
Precision= 
True Positives+False Positives
True Positives
​
 
For Class 0 (non-fraudulent returns):
Precision = 0.49
For Class 1 (fraudulent returns):
Precision = 0.50
Interpretation: For fraudulent returns (Class 1), the model correctly identifies 50% of the predicted frauds. The higher the precision, the fewer false positives.
2. Recall:
Definition: Recall (also called sensitivity or true positive rate) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class (i.e., how many actual relevant instances are selected).
Formula:
Recall
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Negatives
Recall= 
True Positives+False Negatives
True Positives
​
 
For Class 0:
Recall = 0.48
For Class 1:
Recall = 0.51
Interpretation: The model is able to detect 51% of all actual fraudulent returns. The higher the recall, the fewer false negatives.
3. F1-Score:
Definition: The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall and is useful when you want to seek a balance between the two (especially in cases with class imbalance).
Formula:
F1-Score
=
2
×
Precision
×
Recall
Precision
+
Recall
F1-Score=2× 
Precision+Recall
Precision×Recall
​
 
For Class 0:
F1-Score = 0.49
For Class 1:
F1-Score = 0.51
Interpretation: The F1-scores show that the model is about equally good at handling both classes, but overall, the model is not yet performing particularly well (scores are around 0.5).
4. Accuracy:
Definition: Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations.
Formula:
Accuracy
=
True Positives
+
True Negatives
Total Observations
Accuracy= 
Total Observations
True Positives+True Negatives
​
 
Result: Accuracy = 0.50
Interpretation: The model is correct 50% of the time, which is equivalent to random guessing (since it's a binary classification). This suggests the model isn't well-trained yet.
5. ROC-AUC Score:
Definition: The Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) score is a performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between the classes.
Result: ROC-AUC Score = 0.4978
Interpretation: This score is very close to 0.5, which is the performance of a random classifier. This suggests the model is struggling to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent returns.
6. Confusion Matrix:
The confusion matrix shows how well the model predicts true positives (fraud) and true negatives (non-fraud) versus false positives and false negatives:

[
True Negatives
False Positives
False Negatives
True Positives
]
=
[
718
775
733
774
]
[ 
True Negatives
False Negatives
​
  
False Positives
True Positives
​
 ]=[ 
718
733
​
  
775
774
​
 ]
True Negatives (718): The model correctly predicted 718 non-fraudulent returns.
False Positives (775): The model incorrectly predicted 775 returns as fraudulent.
False Negatives (733): The model missed 733 actual fraud cases.
True Positives (774): The model correctly predicted 774 fraudulent returns.
This confusion matrix reflects a lot of misclassifications, which suggests the model could be improved.

How to Compare to Other Algorithms:
You can compare this Logistic Regression model to other algorithms using the same metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and ROC-AUC). When comparing models, here's what to look for:

Higher Precision: If you want fewer false positives, precision is important. Some algorithms like SVM or Random Forest might give better precision.
Higher Recall: If you want to catch as many fraud cases as possible, recall is key. Models like Gradient Boosting or Ensemble Methods often do well with high recall.
Balanced F1-Score: If you're looking for a balance between precision and recall, F1-Score is a good metric to compare.
ROC-AUC: This metric is especially useful for comparing models in imbalanced datasets. A better model will push the ROC-AUC score closer to 1.
