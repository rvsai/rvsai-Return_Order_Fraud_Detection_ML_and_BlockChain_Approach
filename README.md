# Return_Order_Fraud_Detection_A_ML_and_BlockChain_Approach

## Overview
The Return Order Fraud Prediction System is designed to automate and optimize the reverse supply chain, focusing on identifying and preventing fraudulent return orders. The system leverages advanced technologies, including real-time data streaming, machine learning, and blockchain integration, to enhance operational efficiency and security.

---

## Technologies Used

### Real-Time Data Streaming
- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data processing and messaging.

### Machine Learning
- **Models**: Random Forest and XGBoost.
- **Framework**: Scikit-learn for training and testing models.

### Web Framework
- **Flask**: Hosting the Fraud Detection API.

### Database Management
- **MySQL**: Storing transactional data and processed results.

### Programming Languages
- **Python**: For machine learning and API development.
- **Java**: For backend services and data orchestration.

### Blockchain Integration
- **Purpose**: Immutable transaction logs and validation.
- **Smart Contracts**: Enforce business rules.

### Data Storage and Management
- **Format**: JSON-based message serialization in Kafka.

### API Development
- **Type**: RESTful APIs for inter-component communication.

### Scheduling and Automation
- **Spring Boot**: For scheduling tasks and integrating services.

### Deployment and Hosting
- **Tools**: Docker or Kubernetes for scalable containerized environments.

## Services Overview
The system consists of four core services:

### 1. Return Order Scheduler 
#### Role
Schedules and automates the fetching and sending of return order data to Kafka.

#### Key Processes
- **Data Fetching**: Fetch data from the MySQL database at regular intervals.
- **Data Publishing**: Publish messages to Kafka topics with unique identifiers for traceability.

### 2. ROFrauddetectionFlow
#### Role
Evaluates return orders for potential fraud using a hybrid approach.

#### Key Processes
- **Data Retrieval**: Subscribe to Kafka topics and pull data for analysis.
- **Hybrid Fraud Detection**:
  - **Machine Learning Ensemble**: Combine Random Forest and XGBoost with a voting mechanism.
  - **Heuristic Rules**: Apply custom rules, e.g., for excessive returns or mismatched items.
  - **Blockchain Validation**: Use blockchain for transaction verification and smart contract enforcement.
- **Result Publishing**: Publish analysis results and scores to Kafka topics.

### 3. ROFraudDataAnalyser
#### Role
Analyzes processed return data for decision-making and monitoring.

#### Key Processes
- **Data Ingestion**: Pull results from Kafka and store in MySQL.
- **Action Recommendations**: Flag high-risk returns for review and fast-track low-risk ones.
- **API Integration**: Provide RESTful endpoints for querying statuses and behavior.

### 4. Fraud Detection API (Flask)
#### Role
Hosts machine learning models for real-time predictions.

#### Key Processes
- **Model Hosting**: Serve Random Forest and XGBoost models via Flask.
- **Prediction Endpoint**: Provide a `/predict` API for fraud scoring.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly interact with ROFrauddetectionFlow.

## Full Workflow Overview
1. **Data Collection**: Scheduler fetches data and sends it to Kafka.
2. **Fraud Detection**: ROFrauddetectionFlow processes the data using machine learning, rules, and blockchain.3. **Result Storage**: Analyser stores processed data and insights in MySQL.
4. **API Access**: Flask API ensures accessibility for predictions in real-time.

---

## Benefits
1. **Increased Accuracy**: Combines ML models, rules, and blockchain validation.2. **Enhanced Security**: Blockchain ensures tamper-proof transaction logs.
3. **Scalability**: Kafka and distributed services manage high data volumes.
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Automates decisions and prioritizes high-risk returns.
